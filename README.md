# Supply Chain Management Center Induction for Repair Tracker Using a Data Visualization Tool

## Description
### This tool monitors scheduled induction equipment against what is currently on hand

## Introduction
### The Supply Chain Management Center Induction for Repair Tracker Power BI visualization tool was created to provide analysis to ensure that there will always be equipment on hand when it is scheduled to be inducted for repair. If there is no equipment available for an upcoming induction schedule, this tool will highlight this area. Every part of this process has sample code which shows how to do the following:

* How to extract the Condition Code F data from the Global Combat Support System
* How to extract the current Induction and Production data from the Master Scheduling Support Tool
* How to replace the old extracted files with the new files
* How to change the Power BI report scheduled refresh setting
